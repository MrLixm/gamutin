# gamutin

Determine if the colors of a given source are inside the gamut of the target colorspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> gamutin was initially developed to be a finished software one day. But my objectives have changed since, and I don't think this application is pertinent anymore. That way this repository should not receive any more work.
> 
> This repository is made to public so code can be examined. I am still satisfied with how it was designed and I think there is some value to get out of it.

> [!NOTE]
> Visit the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/MrLixm/gamutin/tree/dev) to find the code.

Goals were :

- A tool specialized for one task but that does it well (you judge it).
- Available as CLI, GUI and Python API.
