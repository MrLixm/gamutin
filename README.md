# gamutin

Determine if the colors of a given source are inside the gamut of the target colorspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> gamutin was initially developed to be a finished software one day. But my objectives have changed since, and I don't think this application is pertinent anymore. That way this repository should not receive any more work.
> 
> This repository is made to public so code can be examined. I am still satisfied with how it was designed and I think there is some value to get out of it.

> [!NOTE]
> Visit the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/MrLixm/gamutin/tree/dev) to find the code.

Goals were :

- A tool specialized for one task but that does it well (you judge it).
- Available as CLI, GUI and Python API.

Few points to notice :

- the resource loading system (stylesheet, icons) is overengineered
- since my code style have evolved for more simplicity so its possible not only the resource system is overengineered
- the color-picker widget you can find will probably become a repository of its own
- `core` could have been in a different repo, just easier to have everything here
- `tests` for `editor` are not automatized. You just manually pick which one you want to run and visually check if it looks fine
